# P1: User Research

## Project Idea: Garden guide (e.g. planning, managing and tracking a garden)

The objective for our project is to create a gardening guide program. Specifically, a mobile application, although ideally it would be nice if it could scale to other system without too much modification. The gardening guide should be able to assist in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a given garden. As such we expect the program to be used for any combination of those objectives by essentially any gardener. Thus, the age group, technological abilities, physical and mental abilities, and gender vary quite a bit in our expected users. However, we expect most of our users to not be technological experts. Since gardening is typically a home hobby then the context under which we expect our application to be used in is a relatively calm and relaxed home setting. Although it is possible that our users will wish to check on their garden while on the go and we intend to make that plausible even though we discourage distracted driving.

## Stakeholders and Users

|Stakeholders|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Investors|Investors are those who finance and believe in our product. They are likely to have prior business experience involving the marketing and likely the development of software (mobile applications, etc.).

|General Employees|The general employees consist of anyone who is an employee of the company that is developing the product. General employee experience varies wildly depending on department and background. General employees classify as stakeholders because they are dependent on the products and consequently the company’s financial success.|


## User Research Methods

The research methods we used during our user research are interviews, survey, and secondary research.
 
 
### Justification:

**Interview:** Interviews are highly informative and easy to carry out. Interviews are also good at obtaining primary data from users of our product. Interviews are good at ascertaining what a user wants and expects from the product. 
 
**Survey:** Surveys are good at identifying particular characteristics and perceptions of users that will use our product. This especially an quick way to obtain answers from a large cohort of individuals.
 
**Secondary Research:** Secondary research is useful in that it allows us to develop a point of view on the state of the current product marketplace.Additionally it allows us to review published material and other relevant sources, in order to develop a more informed perspective on the relevant design issues. 


## User Research Method 1: Interview

<!-- ![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image") -->


#### __Method Description:__
In total we interviewed 4 individuals that we considered to be a relatively decent representation of our target audience. We sat down with them for a couple minutes asking our questions and summarizing their responses directly in the document containing those questions. While all of those questions and the summarized responses are included in this document; we did not update the questions with any of the clarification or prompting that was sometimes needed during the interviews. 

---

#### **Summary of Findings:** 
  - Our interviewees mainly keep track of their garden by memory or visual assessment although one of them uses a calendar.
  - A common issue seems to be finding the time to do gardening.
  - A common goal is to be able to see the results of their work. As in all their plants survive and look great.
  - The participants seemed to be at least somewhat familiar with technology.

## User Research Method 2: Survey

<!-- ![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image") -->

#### **Method Description:** 
The survey we created consisted of 10 questions and none of them were required to be filled out by the participant. Meaning that they basically filled out whatever they wanted rather than having to invent some answer for a question they would have preferred to have left blank. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions so that we could have a more qualitative analysis of the results. Also since closed questions take less time than open questions to answer this was done with consideration of the participants as well. We posted the survey on [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) and then shared the [link to it](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BKSFF79) on social media. That resulted in 12 responses to our survey.

---

#### **Summary of Findings:** 
 - Pretty much all the participants grow some kind of edible plants in their gardens. Indicating that some kind of harvest tracking should be a high priority feature.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q1.PNG "Survey Question 1")

 - Most people seem to spend less than 3 hours on gardening per week, at least on average. This may be related to the "lack of time" responses we got during the interviews.
 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q2.PNG "Survey Question 2")

 - Exactly half of our participants are the only person involved in maintaining their garden. Thus to accommodate the other half we should consider making our application so that it can deal with multiple users working on the same garden.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q3.PNG "Survey Question 3")

 - People tend to either water plants on a fixed schedule or only wait a few days for rainfall. What's interesting is that there are rules about watering plants in Australia and it's unlikely that they are the only country with gardening related laws. Thus as a thought we could consider adding functionality which informs the user of their country's laws and tries to ensure that they don't break them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q4.PNG "Survey Question 4")

 - Most participants seem to get a decent amount of rainfall so we should certainly consider rainfall when designing the watering/maintaining section of our application.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5a.PNG "Survey Question 5a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5b.PNG "Survey Question 5b")

 - Most participants would consider using an application for managing their garden so, unless they are just trying to appease us by answering what they think we want to hear, our application wouldn't be completely useless.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q6.PNG "Survey Question 6")

 - Despite tools for planning/setting up a garden winning by first past the post standards, tools for maintaining/managing a garden seem to be  more desired. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7.PNG "Survey Question 7")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7a.PNG "Survey Question 7a")

 - Question 8 had a bunch of cool ideas we hadn't considered yet such as succession planting or companion plant suggestions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8a.PNG "Survey Question 8a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8b.PNG "Survey Question 8b")

 - Most of our participants were not gardening experts so they may want the application to at least somewhat guide them through gardening.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9a.PNG "Survey Question 9a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9b.PNG "Survey Question 9b")

 - As expected most people skipped the last question but there is a comment that such an application would be most useful for managing lots of plants. Thus we should make our UI work just as well with hundreds or thousands of plants as it does with a few dozen.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q10.PNG "Survey Question 10")

 - Overall the survey was more insightful than our 4 interviews even though we considered its questions to be less detailed than the interview questions.

## Task Descriptions

Task 1. George is a 50-something year old man who obtained the gardening app in order to better manage his garden. He has just opened the application on his iPhone, and wants to add a set of plants from his garden to the application. George is familiar with smartphones, but rarely uses his phone for reasons beyond making phone calls, and texting. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: George opens up the app
Step 2: George navigates to the main page
Step 3: George selects the “add plant” button
Step 4: George is prompted by a search bar, and searches the plant he wishes to add
Step 5: George navigates through a list of search results 
Step 6: George selects the plant he wants to add
Step 7: George is prompted by a popup asking him the quantity of the plant he wished to add
Step 8: George selects the quantity of that plant he wishes to add
Step 9: George presses confirm
Step 10: George is redirected to the main page with all of his plant selections displayed.
Step 11: George repeats steps 3-10 until he has added all of the plants in his garden
 
Discussion. George is an example of a typical expected user, as those heavily involved in gardening are likely to be older and have little experience with mobile applications. Similarly, the task type is important and routine. Most users first goal when opening the app is to add all of their plants into their “virtual garden”. 
 
 
 
Task 2. Gladys is a 60-something year old who has just obtained a smart phone and her grandson has installed the gardening app on the phone for her, as she is an avid gardener and may find it useful. She particularly enjoys planting roses, but she wishes to determine how often she should water her newly planted red roses. She has very little experience with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: Gladys opens up the app
Step 2: Gladys navigates to the main page
Step 3: Gladys selects the “add plant” button
Step 4: Gladys is prompted by a search bar, and searches “red roses” 
Step 5: Gladys navigates through a list of search results 
Step 6: Gladys selects the top hit, “red rose” 
Step 7: Gladys is prompted by a popup asking her the quantity of roses she wishes to add
Step 8: Gladys selects the quantity of roses she wishes to add
Step 9: Gladys presses confirm
Step 10: Gladys is redirected to the main page with all of his plant selections displayed.
Step 11: Gladys notices there is an “info” button next to her red roses and selects it
Step 12: Gladys is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her roses
Step 13: Gladys sees the heading “plant maintenance” and sees that under it, it says “water 1-2 times/week”
Step 14: Gladys closes the app and goes out to her garden to water her roses 
 
Discussion. Like George, Gladys and other older adults with plenty of gardening experience, are likely to find the app the most useful. Thus, even though their experience with smartphones is limited, their desire for an efficient way to manage their gardens will make them a large group of the gardening apps users. Her task is an obvious one, as many users want a way to keep track of the maintenance schedules that their gardens require. 
 
 
 
Task 3. Frank is a 20-something year old who has been using the gardening app to manage his garden for 6 months now. He has decided to restructure his garden and remove many of his old plants in order to make room for some new ones. Frank is familiar with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: Frank opens up the app
Step 2: Frank navigates to the main page
Step 3: Frank selects the “-” button displayed next to one of his plants
Step 4: The main page is refreshed, and Frank sees the plant has been removed from his list
Step 5: Frank repeats steps 3 & 4 until all plants are removed 
 
Discussion. Although, Frank is much younger than george and Gladys, he is still an example of a typical user. This is because, although he is an amateur gardener, his extensive experience with smartphones means that he is likely to browse applications/internet to assist him. His task is also an very broad one as users expect to be able to add and in this case, remove, any and all plants in their garden. 
 
 
 
Task 4. Kurt is a 19-year old Biological Sciences student in his second year at U of C. He is currently enrolled in a biology course on the study of plants. Kurt is finding it challenging to memorize all of the plant characteristics for his next exam. He searched the internet for an application that could help him organize the plants that are most discussed in class, and have an efficient way to study their various characteristics. Kurt is almost always on his smartphone and is familiar with almost every aspect of it. He has many applications and is always looking for apps that can improve his life in one way or another. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: Kurt opens up the app
Step 2: Kurt navigates to the main page
Step 3: Kurt selects the “add plant” button
Step 4: Kurt is prompted by a search bar, and searches the (first) plant he wishes to add
Step 5: Kurt navigates through a list of search results 
Step 6: Kurt selects the top hit that has the correct latin name 
Step 7: Kurt is prompted by a popup asking him the quantity of the plant he wished to add. 
Step 8: Kurt inputs “1” as the quantity is irrelevant; since he only need the info. 
Step 9: Kurt presses confirm
Step 10: Kurt is redirected to the main page with his plant selection displayed
Step 11: Kurt repeats steps 3-10 until he has added all of the plants he needs to memorize
Step 12: Kurt selects the “info” button next to the plant he wishes to study
Step 13: Kurt is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for the respective plant
Step 14: Kurt studies the relevant properties in preparation for his exam
Step 15: Kurt repeats steps 12-14 until he satisfied that he has a good understanding of all the plants he is expected to know for his exam
 
Discussion: Although Kurt may not seem like an obvious user, individuals similar to him are likely to be a large portion of users who use the gardening app. This is because many users utilize apps for the information that they provide, and may not utilize all of the functionality. Kurts task is relevant as he is using the app similarly to how a typical gardener would use it; i.e. he is extracting information from the app in order to better understand the plants that are of interest to him. 
 
 
 
Task 5. Tony is a 20-something year old that is not an avid gardener, but has a keen interest in botany. Although he doesn’t wish to start a garden, he wishes to use the app to browse through flowers and learn more about the various types and properties of each flower. Like Frank, Tony is familiar with smartphones but has little experience with gardening. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: Tony opens up the app
Step 2: Tony navigates to the main page
Step 3: Tony selects the “add plant” button
Step 4: Tony is prompted by a search bar, and searches “flower” 
Step 5: Tony navigates through a list of search results and clicks on the clicks on the thumbnail of the top hit
Step 6: Tony is redirected to a new page that displays a photo of the flower, and some basic information below it 
Step 7: Tony swipes through the various flowers and studies the properties below each photo
Step 8: Tony continues to swipe until he is bored
 
Discussion. Like Frank, Tony is young and his curiosity regarding gardening and his knowledge of mobile applications make him a likely user. This is because, although he has little to no experience gardening, his extensive experience with smartphones means that he is likely to browse applications/internet to learn more. His task is also an broad one as users, in addition to managing their garden, want to better understand the plants that are contained in said garden. 
 
 
 
Task 6. Sarah is a 30-something year old who is a botanist. She is an avid gardener as well. She downloaded the app and is curious to see how accurate the information provided is. If it proves to be as accurate as she hopes, she plans to use it for her own garden, and recommend it to her colleagues. She is familiar with smartphones, but does not use many applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
Step 1: Sarah opens up the app
Step 2: Sarah navigates to the main page
Step 3: Sarah selects the “add plant” button
Step 4: Sarah is prompted by a search bar, and searches “cactus” 
Step 5: Sarah navigates through a list of search results and clicks on the “info” tab next to the plant name 
Step 6: Sarah is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her cactus
Step 7: Sarah sees the heading “properties” and verifies whether the information is correct
Step 8: Sarah repeats steps 3-7 until she is satisfied that information provided is correct
 
Discussion. Sarah is a less likely type of user than the ones described previously, but her knowledge and experience of gardening means that she is a prime candidate to test the accuracy and usefulness of the information provided in the app. The task is similarly more specific, but again, if she is satisfied with the accuracy of the information provided, other (more amateur) users are likely to find it useful as well.
